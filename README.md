<h2>Brief desciption of Project</h2>

- There is a user icon and a clickable Youtube icon which will take us to home page via routing.
- Video data is fetched from the YouTube API, which are publicly available and will be displayed on the screen.
- With the help of dynamic routing, we made the video cards clickable.
- For routing,  React Router DOM used to move to different pages.
- For search, search API has been used and the concept of Debouncing to show the search results as the user keeps typing.
- React Hooks like useEffect() for API calls used.
- Shimmer has been added and lazy loading as well.
- Sidebar is there which will appear and can be hidden on clicking the hamburger icon. This is achieved by creating a slice in our store using the concept of React Redux.
- useState() is used in such cases, but to make our app scalable, we have used Redux.
- TailwindCSS is used in our project as our focus is more on functionalities.
